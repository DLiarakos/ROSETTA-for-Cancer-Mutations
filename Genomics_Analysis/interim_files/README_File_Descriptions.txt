df_mutfiles.zip can be unzipped to create a ~180MB file named df_mutfiles.csv. This file contains ROSETTA coded, sequenced samples with sample ID, study ID and mutated gene information for every gene in every sample included in our genomic analysis.
df_Out_preGeneRename.xlsx : is a Case counts "gene vs ROSETTA hist" output from GM's code which is compared to DL's output to show a full match between two indepndent implementations of the genomic case counting pipeline.
Genes_ManyChromosomes.xlsx lists chromosome numbers for all genes for reference while gene renaming as an additional layer of cross-check. If a gene name is truly an alias, it is on the same chromosome.
Genes_Added.xlsx lists all the genes that were aliases for other gene names already present in the frequency counts and are therefore added to other genes and removed from the list of genes.
Genes_Renamed.xlsx lists all the genes which are aliases for other, more commonly known gene names and therefore, were renamed. The rules for adding or renaming genes were obtained from cbioportal.org and are present in the file, reference_data_files/Homo_sapiens_gene_info_GM.txt
Redundant_Patient_ID.xlsx contains all the cases that were redundant accross different studies and therefore only one among the redundant cases were included in our analysis. The included case belong to the most recent study as listed in supplementary data table 2.
