Note: The genomics matrix required to perform reweighting and statistical analysis has been previously generated and included here in the file 'Genomics_Output_Processed.txt'. The code included in this folder downloads raw data from cbioportal and regenerates this file. This process may take several hours depending on the network speed, clock speed and RAM of the computer.

These programs were written in python 3.8.5 and need pandas, random, numpy, matplotlib and multiprocess libraries to run. All of these may be installed using anaconda 	https://www.anaconda.com/ package. Multiprocess library is not installed by default and can be obtained by running following command in anaconda prompt (command line interface).
pip install multiprocess

The python files can be run by the following command:
python <insert-filename>.py

The Jupyter notebook code files need to be run within Jupyter environment. Jupyter can be installed and initiated from the anaconda navigator and starts within the default browser application on the host computer.

clinical/: folder contains clinical files from genomic studies manually curated by ES and MA.

Genomics_Clinical_Mutations_Counter.ipynb: Contains the code to generate pre-processed genomic matrix of frequencies categorized by genes mutated on along the rows and ROSETTA histologies along columns.
	interim_files/: folder contains intermediate files such as a list of all samples counted with corresponding mutated gene, site, histological code etc.
	Genomics_Output/: folder contains the output genomic matrix of genes vs ROSETTA histologies
	reference_data_files/: folder contains input files for the counter code including genomic data generated by DL for cross-comparison, Redundant Hugo_Symbols map and Table2 from our manuscript to order studies reverse chronologically.
Genomics_Clinical_Mutations_Counter.html is a copy of the python code to visualize it within a browser without any need to install python or related packages.

cbioportal_raw_EXOME142_Mar2021/: folder contains raw genomics studies from cbioportal- these are automatically downloaded by Genomics_Clinical_Mutations_Counter.py code by running 'Raw_Studies_Downloader.py'.

reference_data_files/MutationsPipelines_CompareWithDavid.ipynb : Jupyter notebook that compares the two genomics pipelines implemented by two coauthors independently for counting the same number of samples for every study. Results are identical in the two pipelines.
